# playground
playground of non-official oneDM data models.
The models here are intended as experimental submissions that indeed potentially could work.
They are not commitments by the submitting entity that they are going to be exactly the way forward.
Note that there is another repository, "exploratory", that can be used for exploring new SDF features or new model translation design patterns.

Experimental CI: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/one-data-model/playground.svg?branch=master
