      "description": "This IPSO object is used to time events and actions, using patterns common to industrial timers. A write to the trigger resource or On/Off input state change starts the timing operation, and the timer remaining time shows zero when the operation is complete. The patterns supported are One-Shot (mode 1), On-Time or Interval (mode 2), Time delay on pick-up or TDPU (mode 3), and Time Delay on Drop-Out or TDDO (mode 4). Mode 0 disables the timer, so the output follows the input with no delay. A counter is provided to count occurrences of the timer output changing from 0 to 1. Writing a value of zero resets the counter. The Digital Input State resource reports the state of the timer output.",
